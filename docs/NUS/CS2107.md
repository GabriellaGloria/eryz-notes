## About CS2107 - Introduction to Information Security 🔒  

**CS2107 NUSMods: [link](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2107/introduction-to-information-security)**  

I took CS2107 in **AY24/25 Semester 1**, under **Prof. Chang Ee Chien** 💯.  

CS2107 introduces students to the **principles and practices of information security**, covering general topics like **encryption** 🔑, **authentication protocols**, **secure communication**, **network security**, and **common vulnerabilities** such as buffer overflows, format string, and SQL injection 🫡.

Lectures are offline every week, and recordings are available on **Canvas** 💻, with weekly tutorials that uses more real-world case scenarios. Prof explained the concepts clearly, and easy to understand for everyone 🗂. The topics are also not too advanced 🎥. 

Assessments include **in-class quizzes**, **assignments**, **midterms** and **final exam** 📖. The course has 2 **CTF assignments**, where we need to pick and solve some of the problems, and submit our writeups. Midterms and final exam are MCQ and relatively easy, cheatsheets are allowed 📄. If you do enough PYPs, most questions can be solved in seconds (terminologies, concepts). CS2107 is the only exam I've done where many students already leave the venue in an hour 📝. 

Personally, I think the concepts in CS2107 are **very beginner-friendly** 🙂‍↔️, and it covers the important basics of Information Security. Although most of the topics covered are not new to me, I still enjoy going to the lectures 🫶, especially since Prof likes to joke during lectures. I recommend to take this mod if you are new and interested to security 💕.
