## About CS1231S - Discrete Structures 🐣

**CS1231S NUSMods : [link](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS1231S/discrete-structures)**

I took CS1231S in **AY2324 Semester 2**, under Prof Aaron Tan. 

CS1231S introduces key **mathematical concepts** crucial for computer science, including logic, set theory, functions, infinite numbers, combinatorics, and graph theory. Students learn proof techniques like induction and contradiction and explore applications of these structures in computing. By focusing on abstraction and problem-solving, the course builds a **foundation** for understanding algorithms, data structures, and theoretical aspects of computer science, making it integral for further studies in the field 💅.

This course has 2 written assignments, Midterms and Finals. Midtems & Finals are openbook (printed materials), using pen & paper 🤧.

I personally liked how Prof Aaron explains the topics, and giving great examples for the concepts. He explained everything really well, so it was easy to understand. Most of the topics are already familiar to me, but I wish I could learn these from him before.

I never skipped the lectures (probably 1/2 i forgot..) since I really enjoyed it 👍! The tutorial questions are also nice (i only skip when i cant wake up 🙂‍↕️..)

Oh, I got chocolate from Prof Aaron for participating in the Monty Hall lecture 😎!

**Enjoyment : 5/5 🫶**</br>
**Workload : 4-5h/week (2h lecture, 1h tutorial, 1h assignment)**</br>
**Grade : A+ (got top students yay!)**</br>
