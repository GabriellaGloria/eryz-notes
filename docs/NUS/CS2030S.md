## About CS2030S - Programming Methodology II 💻  

**CS2030S NUSMods: [link](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2030S/programming-methodology-ii)**  

I took CS2030S in **AY24/25 Semester 1**, under **Prof Adi Yoga** 🧠.  

CS2030S introduces students to **programming concept/paradigms** and focusing on topics like **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **functional programming (FP)**, **streams**, **concurrency**, and **immutability** 📚. The course is taught using **Java** and emphasizes writing clean, modular, and reusable code 📌.  

The lectures are offline and weekly, recordings available on **Canvas** 📝, while weekly lab sessions and recitations focueses on applying the concepts to practical problems. The labs and recitations are particularly engaging, and solutions are discussed by TAs 📂.

Assessments include **quizzes** 📋, **labs** 🛠️, and **programming assignments** 💻. The programming assignments can be quite challenging, with weekly tasks we need to implement. There are also pen & paper **midterms** and **final exams**, which only allow cheatsheet 📖. We have 2 PA (programming assessments), one for OOP, and other for FP, (also +1 mock PA 🙏).

I think this course is not **hard** in concepts, but you will need to do a **lot of practices** to be comfortable with the PA/exam. Prof explained the concepts in clear during lectures, and also have **[CS2030S website](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2425-s1/)** for us to revise 😮‍💨. CS2030S provides enough foundation in both OOP and FP, which are essential skills for software development 👍.
