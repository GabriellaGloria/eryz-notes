## About CS2109S - Introduction to AI and Machine Learning 🤖  

**CS2109S NUSMods: [link](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2109S/introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning)**  

I took CS2109S in **AY24/25 Semester 1**, under **Prof Rizki Maulana**, **Patrick Rebentrost**, and **Hu Conghui** 😸.  

CS2109S introduces students to the **fundamentals of artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**, covering a range of topics such as **search algorithms**, **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, and **neural networks** 😵‍💫.

The lectures are offline every week with in-lecture quizzes on pollev (no recordings 😴), with weekly tutorials. Coursemology is used as the main platform for CS2109S, instead of Canvas 😼.

Assessments include **quizzes** 📋, **coding assignments** 💻, **midterms** and **final exam** 📝. The coding assignments focus on implementing algorithms. We also have a contest about connect-4. Every problemset has many questions, and will need you a lot of time to finish it. Use of ChatGPT/AI is allowed in CS2109S, but you'll need to give a reference to it 🫠.

The topics covered are introductory, and supposedly easy (but some topics will spam lots of maths 🫡). It will probably need you to review & think about the math (but not really tested). I personally enjoy the topics, however I am not particularly interested in AI/ML 😢. The midterms and finals were quite hard? (the questions descriptions are really long, my english reading skills just gave up or I am just skill issue 🤡). However, I think if you're interested in AI, you might will like this course 😗.

**Enjoyment : 4.3/5 🩷**</br>
**Workload : 4-5h/week (2h lecture, 1h tutorial, 2h assignment)**</br>
**Grade : A- 😭**</br>
